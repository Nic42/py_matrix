A python implementation of the transfer matrix method for multilayer structures with arbitrary dielectric tensors. If you find py-matrix useful for generating results included in publications, please consider citing the following paper:

Pellegrini G. and Mattei G. (2014) **High-Performance Magneto-Optic Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor Design: An Optimization Approach.**  *Plasmonics 1â€“6*. [doi:10.1007/s11468-014-9764-6](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11468-014-9764-6 "doi:10.1007/s11468-014-9764-6")

## Installation

Installing **py_matrix** should be fairly easy. First of all you need a python distribution on your system. The simplest thing to do if you are using **Windows** or **OSX** would be to install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), a beautiful, free, and easy to use python distribution: the relevant installations instructions are found [here](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html). If you are using **Linux** you probably already know how to install python on your system, nevertheless my advice is to also install [The IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which is already bundled in Anaconda.

The second step would be installing **py_matrix** itself. If you are familiar with [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://github.com/) you can simply clone the repository, otherwise just [download](https://github.com/gevero/py-matrix/archive/master.zip) the zipped version of the repo and unpack it wherever you like.

## Usage

The best thing to do for the moment is to start from the **.ipynb** files in the [examples](https://github.com/gevero/py-matrix/tree/master/examples) folder. You can load them in your local IPython Notebook instance: they should give you a fair idea about how to proceed for your calculations. Each function in the code features a detailed documentation easily accessible with the `Shift-Tab` tool-tip shortcut from the IPython Notebook interface.
